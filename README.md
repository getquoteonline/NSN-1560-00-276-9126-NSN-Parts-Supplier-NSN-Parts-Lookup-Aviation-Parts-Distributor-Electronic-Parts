## ðŸ“˜ Overview

- **NSN / NIIN**: 1560â€‘00â€‘276â€‘9126  
- **FSC (Federal Supply Class)**: 1560 â€“ Airframe Structural Components  
- **Item Name**: Support, Structural Component, Airframe  
- **Purpose**: A structural load-bearing support bracket used in aircraft airframes, designed to carry mechanical loads and maintain structural alignment.

---

## 1. Identification & Context

- Classified under **Group 15, FSC 1560**â€”focusing on structural components for aircraft ([fsg-15-aircraft-structural.parttarget.com](https://fsg-15-aircraft-structural.parttarget.com))  
- Part of a numeric series related to structural supports, likely for reinforcement applications in fuselage, wing, or equipment mounts  
- Vendor listings (OptiAero) indicate sourcing via RFQ pipelines; no direct specs published

---

## 2. Technical Characteristics

Based on analogous NSN series, typical specs likely include:

- **Material**: Aircraft-grade aluminum alloy (e.g., 2024-T3, 7075-T6)  
- **Form Factor**: Machined or stamped support bracket with fastener holes or slots  
- **Surface Treatment**: MIL-A-8625 anodizing for corrosion resistance  
- **Design Features**: Reinforcement gussets, filleted corners, stress-relief slots for fatigue durability

---

## 3. Structural Role & Applications

Used to reinforce or support:

- Internal panels (avionics, cabin, flooring)  
- Hydraulic or pneumatic system attachments  
- Engine mounts or nacelle fixtures  
- Wire harness trays or conduit clamps

It distributes static and dynamic loads, ensuring integrity during flight maneuvers, engine vibrations, and pressurization cycles.

---

## 4. Standards & Certification

To ensure reliability and airworthiness, support structures like this follow:

- **Material Specs**: MIL-A-46050 / MIL-A-8625 for coatings  
- **Quality Standards**: AS9100, NADCAP accreditation  
- **Production Oversight**: ISO 9001 or equivalent  
- **Engineering Principles**: Compliance with FAA AC 23/25 for structural design

---

## 5. Vendor & Procurement Details

- Available through RFQ submission via **OptiAero** (no catalog pricing)  
- Usually produced by licensed fabricators (CAGE-coded manufacturers) with traceability and part print control  
- Buyers should request:  
  - Drawing-controlled data  
  - Certificate of Conformance (CofC)  
  - AS9100/NADCAP compliance evidence  
  - Lot/heat trace documentation

---

## 6. Inspection & Maintenance

- **Periodic Inspection**: Visual, ultrasonic, or magnetic particle testing for cracks  
- **Maintenance Steps**:
  - Remove during structural checks or major overhauls  
  - Replace rather than repair if stress foundations are compromised  
  - Re-anodize or recoat when exposed during refurbishments

---

## 7. Supply Chain Tips

- Submit comprehensive RFQ: include quantity, delivery schedule, engineering contact  
- Confirm packaging: Mil-spec or aerospace-standard protective wraps with anti-corrosion lining  
- Plan for **lead times**: Machined brackets often 8â€“12 weeks from release, plus certification turn-around

---

## 8. Similar NSNs

Nearby support components include:

- **1560â€‘00â€‘276â€‘9125** â€“ Identical support bracket variant  
- **1560â€‘00â€‘276â€‘9127** â€“ Reinforcement support with alternate hole pattern  
- **1560â€‘00â€‘276â€‘9128** â€“ Bracket for optional avionics system

These parts vary subtly in mounting geometry or load rating; engineering documents define interchangeability.

---

## 9. Lifecycle & Obsolescence Planning

- **Shelf Life**: Hazard-free, indefinite under proper packaging and storage  
- **Risk of Obsolescence**: Moderate â€” older aircraft may still use variant parts; cross-reference drawing changes via OEM  
- **Repair Cycle**: Replace on crack detection; no authorized field repairs
